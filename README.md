Got it 👍 Since this is a simple Swift BMI calculator app for learning segues and transitions, I’ll prepare a clean and minimal README.md file for GitHub. You can later add badges, screenshots, or demo GIFs if you want.

Here’s a good starter README:

# 📱 BMI Calculator (Swift)

A simple **BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator** iOS app built in **Swift**.  
This project was created to understand and implement **segues** and **screen transitions** in iOS development.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Takes **Height** and **Weight** input from the user  
- Calculates the **BMI**  
- Displays the result on the next screen using **segue**  
- Includes a **Back button** to return to the input screen

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Swift  
- **Framework:** UIKit  
- **IDE:** Xcode
